                      conform to the corresponding NotificationChannelDescriptor's
                      schema, unlike the labels field. This field is intended to be
                      used for organizing and identifying the NotificationChannel
                      objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and
                      value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever
                      is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters,
                      numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.

                    description: Indicates whether this channel has been verified
                      or not. On a ListNotificationChannels or GetNotificationChannel
                      operation, this field is expected to be populated.If the value
                      is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning
                      (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise,
                      it is assumed that the channel works.If the channel is neither
                      VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the channel is of a
                      type that does not require verification or that this specific
                      channel has been exempted from verification because it was created
                      prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This
                      field cannot be modified using a standard UpdateNotificationChannel
                      operation. To change the value of this field, you must call
                      VerifyNotificationChannel.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources

                        (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is
                        important.
