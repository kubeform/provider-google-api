                          in a zone is rounded up. During patching, a VM is considered
                          disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until
                          patching has completed. This disruption time includes the
                          time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps. A VM contributes
                          to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails
                          either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch
                          steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification
                          before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have
                          an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget.
                          For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a
                          zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing
                          to the next zone requires completion of the patch process
                          in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption budget
                          has a fixed value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the
                          current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at
                          a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed
                          successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the
                          next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the
                          patch job stops.

                        description: The maximum number (or percentage) of VMs per
                          zone to disrupt at any given moment. The number of VMs calculated
                          from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs
                          in a zone is rounded up. During patching, a VM is considered
                          disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until
                          patching has completed. This disruption time includes the
                          time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps. A VM contributes
                          to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails
                          either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch
                          steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification
                          before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have
                          an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget.
                          For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a
                          zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing
                          to the next zone requires completion of the patch process
                          in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption budget
                          has a fixed value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the
                          current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at
                          a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed
                          successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the
                          next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the
                          patch job stops.
