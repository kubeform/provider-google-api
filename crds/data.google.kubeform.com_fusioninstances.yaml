                      the user will be able to create data pipelines using point and
                      click UI. However, there are certain limitations, such as fewer
                      number of concurrent pipelines, no support for streaming pipelines,
                      etc. - ENTERPRISE: Enterprise Data Fusion instance. In Enterprise
                      type, the user will have more features available, such as support
                      for streaming pipelines, higher number of concurrent pipelines,
                      etc. - DEVELOPER: Developer Data Fusion instance. In Developer
                      type, the user will have all features available but with restrictive
                      capabilities. This is to help enterprises design and develop
