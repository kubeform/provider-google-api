                            messageType, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, NOT
                            messageType = \"ADT\". * send_date or sendDate, the YYYY-MM-DD
                            date the message was sent in the dataset's timeZone, from
                            the MSH-7 segment. For example, send_date < \"2017-01-02\".
                            * sendTime, the timestamp when the message was sent, using
                            the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7
                            segment. For example, sendTime < \"2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00\".
                            * sendFacility, the care center that the message came
                            from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, sendFacility
                            = \"ABC\". * PatientId(value, type), which matches if
                            the message lists a patient having an ID of the given
                            value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments.
                            For example, PatientId(\"123456\", \"MRN\"). * labels.x,
                            a string value of the label with key x as set using the
                            Message.labels map. For example, labels.\"priority\"=\"high\".
                            The operator :* can be used to assert the existence of
                            a label. For example, labels.\"priority\":*."
