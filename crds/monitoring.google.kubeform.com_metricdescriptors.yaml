                      DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of the stored
                      metric values. \n Different systems may scale the values to
                      be more easily displayed (so a value of 0.02KBy might be displayed
                      as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as 3.5MBy).
                      However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is
                      always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed.
                      \n If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of
                      CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE
                      metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just
                      s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written
                      as 12005. \n Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record
                      data in a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE
                      metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005
                      (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which

                      DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of the stored
                      metric values. \n Different systems may scale the values to
                      be more easily displayed (so a value of 0.02KBy might be displayed
                      as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as 3.5MBy).
                      However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is
                      always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed.
                      \n If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of
                      CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE
                      metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just
                      s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written
                      as 12005. \n Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record
                      data in a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE
                      metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005
                      (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which
                      is 12005/1024). The supported units are a subset of The Unified
                      Code for Units of Measure standard. More info can be found in
