                      Test. \n You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual
                      machine (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely
                      identify the source location. \n Examples: If the source IP
                      address is an internal IP address within a Google Cloud Virtual
                      Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also specify the
                      VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which already
                      contains its internal IP address and VPC network information.
                      \n If the source of the test is within an on-premises network,
                      then you must provide the destination VPC network. \n If the
                      source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                      network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
                      identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source
                      IP address or VPC network. \n A reachability analysis proceeds
                      even if the source location is ambiguous. However, the test
                      result may include endpoints that you don't intend to test."
